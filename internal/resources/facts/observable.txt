Observables are data artifacts linked to security incidents, such as IP addresses, email addresses, domain names, file hashes, or URLs.
They are the primary inputs for automated analysis and are used to enrich investigations in TheHive.
To find the alerts, cases and other entities in which a specific observable can be found, you need to query for the observable's extraData links.
