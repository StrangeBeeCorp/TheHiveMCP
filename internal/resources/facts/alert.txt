# Definition
An alert is a security event generated by detection tools such as SIEM, IDS, EDR, firewalls, or threat intelligence platforms like MISP. It serves as an early warning that helps analysts identify, investigate, and respond to potential threats.

Alerts are reviewed, triaged, and transformed into cases for deeper investigation.

# Sources
Manual alert creation not possible

You can't manually create an alert in TheHive. Alerts must be generated by external tools connected to TheHive.

An alert can be created from the following sources:

Detection tools such as SIEM, IDS, EDR, or firewalls connected to TheHive

Threat intelligence platforms like MISP connected to TheHive

Email servers connected to TheHive

# Key components
In TheHive, an alert includes the following elements:

Observables: Data points such as IP addresses, file hashes, domains, and email addresses that are relevant to an investigation.
