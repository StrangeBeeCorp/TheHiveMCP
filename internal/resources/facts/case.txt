#Definition
A case is a structured entity used to track, investigate, and respond to security incidents, threats, or suspicious activities. It serves as a central repository where security teams organize information, collaborate on investigations, and document their findings.

#Sources
In TheHive, you can create a case from the following sources:
Manual entry: Create a case manually by entering details.
Case templates: Use predefined templates to standardize and simplify case creation.
Archived cases: Restore cases from previous investigations stored in TheHive.
MISP event files: Create cases by manually importing MISP events for further investigation.
Alerts: Convert alerts from connected detection tools (SIEM, EDR, IDS, or firewalls), threat intelligence platforms (like MISP), or email servers into cases for further investigation.
Detection tools (SIEM, EDR, IDS, or firewalls): Create cases directly from your detection tools if you prefer to manage alert triage there or if you trust the tool to generate mostly true positives.

# Key components
In TheHive, a case includes the following elements:
Observables: Data points such as IP addresses, file hashes, domains, and email addresses that are relevant to an investigation.
Tasks: Actions assigned to analysts to analyze, assess, and mitigate threats.
TTPs: The methods and strategies used by attackers, based on the MITRE ATT&CK knowledge base.
