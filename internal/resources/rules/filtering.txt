- Do not filter on non existent fields, even if required by the user.
- Make sure your filters are valid and can be interpreted by the Hive. This is more important than the user's request.
- If the user does not specify filters, return all the results within the default limit.
- Use the num_results parameters to limit the number of results returned.
- Use the kept columns parameter to retrieve the information requested by the user. Note that entity-specific defaults are automatically applied: alerts include severity/status, cases include status/severity, tasks include assignee, observables include dataType.
- It is impossible to filter an entity on it's extraData or additionalQueries.
