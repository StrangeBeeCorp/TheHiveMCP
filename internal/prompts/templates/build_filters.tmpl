## Instructions
Write precise filters for the Hive to search for {{ .CustomData.EntityType }} based on the user's request.
The user will provide a natural language query describing the desired filters. And additional parameters such as the number of results to return, the columns to keep, and sorting preferences.
Feel free to overwrite the user's parameters if you believe different values would yield better results.
The filters should be valid and can be interpreted by the Hive.
If the user's request cannot be fulfilled, return an error message explaining why as explained in the integrity rules. This is very important, trying to fulfill impossible requests will lead to confusion for the client. Better inform the user of the issue and let them adjust their request. You can point the user to the get-resource tool to explore the available entities and their fields.
